# FreeCAD Architectural Truss Tools

This directory contains FreeCAD macros for generating various types of architectural trusses with FEM (Finite Element Method) analysis setup.

## Macros Included

### 1. Pyramidal Truss (`pyramidal-truss.FCMacro`)
Creates a 3-sided pyramidal truss with:
- Triangular base with configurable side length
- Apex point with configurable height
- Two horizontal reinforcement levels at 1/3 and 2/3 of the height
- Diagonal bracing between reinforcement levels
- Circular beam cross-sections with configurable radius
- Complete FEM analysis setup with:
  - Steel material properties
  - Fixed constraints at the base
  - Downward force at the apex
  - Gmsh mesh generation

### 2. Rectangular Truss (`nava-freecad.FCMacro`)
Similar to the pyramidal truss but with different dimensions:
- Larger base side length (4.0 units instead of 1.0)
- Different height (3.0 units)
- Uses CalculiXCcxTools solver
- Uses Netgen meshing instead of Gmsh
- Includes instructions for running analysis automatically

### 3. Three Column Truss (`three_column_truss.FCMacro`)
A more complex three-column architectural truss design:
- Three parallel columns with configurable length, width, and height
- Segmented structure with configurable number of segments
- Comprehensive bracing:
  - Horizontal chord members on top and bottom
  - Vertical members
  - Diagonal web members
  - Cross-bracing between columns
- FEM analysis with:
  - Fixed constraints at six corner points
  - Different force loads on each column (middle column has higher load)
  - CalculiXCcxTools solver
  - Netgen meshing

## Usage

1. Open FreeCAD (version 1.0.0 or later)
2. Open the Macro menu (Macro â†’ Macros...)
3. Click "Add" and browse to the .FCMacro file you want to use
4. Select the macro and click "Execute"

The macro will automatically:
- Create a new document
- Generate the truss structure
- Set up the FEM analysis
- Configure materials, constraints, and mesh
- Save the file (to /tmp by default)

## Compatibility Notes

- The macros include error handling for different FreeCAD versions
- If using Gmsh, ensure it's installed on your system
- Some FEM features may require manual configuration depending on your FreeCAD version
- Solver properties and mesh creation methods adapt to the available features

## Parameters

Each macro has configurable parameters at the top of the file:
- Dimensions (side length, height, width)
- Beam radius (thickness)
- For the three-column truss: number of segments, spacing, etc.

Modify these values to customize the truss to your specific requirements.

## Advanced Usage

The macros include commented code sections that can:
- Run the analysis automatically (uncomment the relevant sections)
- Generate and display results
- Create additional visualization objects

## Requirements

- FreeCAD 1.0.0+
- FEM workbench
- CalculiX (included with FreeCAD)
- Gmsh (for pyramidal truss) or Netgen (for rectangular and three-column trusses)
